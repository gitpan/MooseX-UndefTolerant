Revision history for MooseX-UndefTolerant

0.08    February 27, 2011
    * Additional (TODO) unit tests for immutable classes, and documentation
      notes about these limitations. (Karen Etheridge)

    * Added forward compatibility with Moose 1.9900+, but this module still
      works with older Moose too. (Dave Rolsky)

0.07
    * Don't do extra work by exists-ing before defined-ing (Chip Salzenberg)

0.06
    * Add support for immutable classes (Chris Andrews)
    * Be more careful avoiding warnings when the init_arg is undef (Chris Andrews)
    * POD fixups

0.05
    * Avoid warnings from Moose 1.09. (Dave Rolsky)

0.04    January 23, 2010
    * Rather than skipping initialization all together, just pop off the undef
      and let the init happen normally.  This makes default values work
      properly. (Test provided by (and thanks to) Tom Heady)

0.03    December 3, 2009
    * Fiddle with dependencies.

0.02    December 2, 2009
